# Project AUTHOR - CI Milestone Project 1

An author site to promote and share the fictional works of yours truly!

## UX

This website is for readers of science fiction or thrillers, both fans of my esteemed work or those with a cursory interest.

The aim is to generate sufficient interest to warrant them visiting the book in the respective book vendor retail site.

## Features

### Existing

* Used a sliding image which scrolls on the x-axis to showcase my books. This was achieved entirely through CSS, stitching the book covers together in 1 long image at the suggestion of my mentor. The code was inspired by the following [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3_qXLoIFds)
